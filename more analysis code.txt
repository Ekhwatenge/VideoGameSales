6. Customer Behavior and Retention
6.1 Repeat Purchases
If you have data on customer IDs and their purchases, you can analyze which games tend to lead to repeat purchases, particularly for sequels or expansion packs.

```{r}

# Sample data columns: Customer_ID, Game_Name, Purchase_Date

# Count repeat purchases for each game
repeat_purchases <- vg_data %>%
  group_by(Name) %>%
  summarise(Repeat_Purchases = n_distinct(Customer_ID)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Repeat_Purchases))

# Plotting Repeat Purchases by Game
ggplot(repeat_purchases, aes(x = reorder(Name, -Repeat_Purchases), y = Repeat_Purchases)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Repeat Purchases by Game", x = "Game", y = "Number of Repeat Purchases") +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
```

6.2 Churn Analysis
If you have subscription data (e.g., Customer_ID, Subscription_Status, Last_Active_Date), you can track churn rates.

```{r}
# Sample data columns: Customer_ID, Subscription_Status, Last_Active_Date

# Churn Rate Calculation
churn_data <- vg_data %>%
  filter(Subscription_Status == "Inactive") %>%
  mutate(Churn_Rate = n_distinct(Customer_ID) / n_distinct(Customer_ID[Subscription_Status == "Active"]))

# Plotting Churn Rate
ggplot(churn_data, aes(x = Subscription_Status, y = Churn_Rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "salmon") +
  labs(title = "Customer Churn Rate", x = "Subscription Status", y = "Churn Rate") +
  theme_minimal()
```

7. Marketing and Review Analysis
Use text reviews and marketing spend data for Review Sentiment Analysis and Marketing Spend Efficiency.

7.1 Review Sentiment Analysis
analyze the text of customer reviews. Assuming you have a Review_Text and Rating column, use text analysis libraries in R like tidytext.

```{r}

# Sample data columns: Review_Text, Rating

# Tokenize and calculate sentiment scores for each review
reviews <- vg_data %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, Review_Text) %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(sentiment, sort = TRUE)

# Plotting Sentiment Analysis
ggplot(reviews, aes(x = sentiment, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "Review Sentiment Analysis", x = "Sentiment", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

7.2 Marketing Spend Efficiency
Assuming Marketing_Spend and Sales columns are present, you could calculate the return on marketing investment (ROMI) by comparing sales impact per marketing dollar spent.

```{r}
# Sample data columns: Marketing_Spend, Global_Sales

# Calculating ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment)
marketing_efficiency <- vg_data %>%
  group_by(Game_Name) %>%
  summarise(Total_Marketing_Spend = sum(Marketing_Spend, na.rm = TRUE),
            Total_Sales = sum(Global_Sales, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(ROMI = Total_Sales / Total_Marketing_Spend)

# Plotting ROMI by Game
ggplot(marketing_efficiency, aes(x = reorder(Game_Name, -ROMI), y = ROMI)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Return on Marketing Investment by Game", x = "Game", y = "ROMI") +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
```
